Face detection using MTCNN (Multi Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks)
It is a deep learning-based algorithm used for face detection, particularly in real-time or near-real-time applications.
It gives better Accurate results but takes comparatively more time especially on higher resolution images and videos.
